Hello World, welcome to my corner of the internet. I want to use this as my gateway for sharing ideas, guides and keep track of the topics I explored.

I'm aiming for the end result to be a blend of [Troy Hunt](https://www.troyhunt.com/)'s technical blog and [Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html)'s essays. With a sprinkle of humour on top.

‌Setting up a new website is always fun and exciting, but an empty blog is no fun. I find it entertaining exploring new services, providers and seeing what's the shiniest new web development technology. But, as it's often the case, this leads me down in an infinite rabbit hole, searching for the "best" tool, technology and of course, to understand why that is the case. If I'm not careful, this never ending story can lead me off the main path and end up doing nothing.

I did it so many times, I've lost count, but I learnt my lesson (I 
think). This time around the solution is as simple and cost-effective as 
possible, the motto is _keeping it simple_.

### When?

There's not a set date or a schedule _per se_, but I'll try to be consistent.

### How?

The in depth _how to_ is a story for another day, but here's a list of the tools used:
