Having a long name has many challenges, one of them is to have a proper email without having to write the _Divina Commedia_ every time I sign up on a new website. This is the main reason, ever since I understood the concept of a domain and the beauty of having your own personalized email, I did it.This allowed me go get creative and have some fun. Mainly with short emails, for example I use n at vecr.me as my newslettter email, easy to write and easy to fliter out in a specified folder. The freedom of owing your domain and by extect your email address, leaves you with the liberty to change provider at will without the hassle to spend a month changeing emails on every website you have an account. **Categorization**  A few years ago, Google had this wonderful concept of a 'smart' inbox appropriatley named **Inbox by Gmail**

As many things Google, [it got killed](https://gcemetery.co/inbox-by-gmail/) and never to be replaced. But with the power of simple filters, you too can create the poor's man 'smart' inbox. By having unlimted aliases, a few minutes to spare and the willingness to follow a few simple rules, your inbox will work for you and not the other way around. **The categories**Main aka allNewslettersProxiedPublicHealthTravelWorkThere are multiple reasons one might choose to this route by buying a domain and using it One being ease of transfer, _in theory_ if I so choose I can change the provider without much hassle while still using the same emails I used for the past 8 years.Ownership
